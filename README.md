## Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting weather data from the cities.csv file located in the resources folder. 

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. I also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

# Built With
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap
* Python 
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

# Website Components

The website includes seven pages:

* A landing page containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page.
* Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A comparison page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.
  * The table is a bootstrap table component.
  * The data comes from exporting the `.csv` file as HTML, or converting it to HTML. 


# Deploy
The website is deployed to GitHub pages.
